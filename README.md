# Amulet Of Chemistry Alerter
Tired of making potions without an amulet of chemistry? Stop wasting potential stamina potion doses with this plugin

This plugin will alert you when your amulet of chemistry breaks. 

If you want to use the "Notify by ID" feature, use https://static.runelite.net/api/runelite-api/constant-values.html 
to find the IDs. Enter the ID for the primary potion ingredient (usually unf potions and finished potions), separated by commas

I will update this README with a list of all unfinished potion IDs by the end of this year
